# #Lambdas, also known as anonymous functions, are small, restricted functions which do not need a name (i.e., an identifier).
# Every lambda function in Python has 3 essential parts:
# The lambda keyword.
# The parameters (or bound variables), and
# The function body.
# The syntax for writing a lambda is: lambda parameter: expression
#Syntax:

lambda x : x + x
#Syntax:

def sum(x) : return x + x
